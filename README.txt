This question requires a program to map a model's output labels to the names of
the classes they represent. From my understanding, I need to loop through the
example file, extract the label(id number) and class name(animal names) from
the file, and use the class 'LabelMap' from the deep learning framework caffe
to map the label to the name, therefore generate a so called label map.
Afterwards I stored the result in a new file.
